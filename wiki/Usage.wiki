<br />
When prompted, enter the name of the target function you wish to find paths to:

<br />
Nodes with direct calls to the target function will be highlighted. Double clicking on any node will take you to that function in the disassembly window:

<br />


= Filters =

Nodes can be dynamically included or excluded using the right-click menu:

<br />
To show only paths that traverse a certain node, select the *Include* option and click on the desired node:

To exclude all paths that travers a certain node, select the *Exclude* option and click on the desired node:

Include and exclude actions can be undone (but there is no re-do), and the graph can also be reset to its original state.
